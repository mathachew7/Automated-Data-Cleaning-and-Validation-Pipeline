# Automated Data Cleaning and Validation Pipeline

## Project Overview
This project automates the process of data cleaning and validation using a Dockerized Python pipeline. It handles common data quality issues, such as:
- Removing duplicates
- Filling or imputing missing values
- Validating data types and formats

The pipeline is designed to save time, improve data quality, and provide reusable components for similar tasks across industries.

---

## Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Handles missing values, duplicates, and incorrect formats.
- **Validation**: Ensures data integrity using rules for consistency and quality checks.
- **Automation**: Fully containerized pipeline using Docker for portability and scalability.
- **Reports**: Generates data quality reports summarizing detected issues.

---

## Technology Stack
- **Python**: Core logic for data cleaning and validation.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and processing.
- **Docker**: Containerization for portability and scalability.
- **Apache Airflow (Optional)**: For orchestration and scheduling.
- **AWS S3 (Optional)**: For storing cleaned data.

## How to Run the Pipeline

### Prerequisites
- Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
- Install Python (if testing outside Docker).

### Steps
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/automated-data-cleaning-pipeline.git
   cd automated-data-cleaning-pipeline
2. Build the docker image
   docker build -t data_cleaning_pipeline .
   
4. Run the pipeline
   docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app data_cleaning_pipeline

5. Check the Output: The cleaned data will be saved in cleaned_data.csv in the project folder


Future Enhancements
Add more advanced validation rules (e.g., using PyDeequ or Apache Spark).
Integrate with cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage).
Schedule pipeline runs using Apache Airflow or Prefect.
Create interactive dashboards for data quality reports.
